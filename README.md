# PaperClip Habit Tracker

In 1993, a bank in Abbotsford, Canada, hired a twenty-three-year-old
stockbroker named Trent Dyrsmid. Abbotsford was a relatively small
suburb, tucked away in the shadow of nearby Vancouver, where most
of the big business deals were being made. Given the location, and the
fact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too much of him. But
he made brisk progress thanks to a simple daily habit.
Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was
filled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled
in each day, he would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would
move one paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process
would begin again. “Every morning I would start with 120 paper clips
in one jar and I would keep dialing the phone until I had moved them
all to the second jar”.
